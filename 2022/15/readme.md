# Part 1

part1.awk is the obvious and obviously slow, implementation.

# Part 2

The approach fails due to memory constraints (needs guaranteed 16T elements), and is replace with a faster algorithm.

For some reasons, part 2 still takes a few minutes to crunch. Needs to be investigated (and improved).
