# Base solution (merged.awk)

The solution is primarily brute force with optimizations for speedup. The
original solution uses a caching strategy that recognizes a position and
aborts if the current cost of movement is the same or higher than the previous
time this position was encountered.

# First optimizations (mergedb.awk)

This caching strategy looked at the previous cost. Caching the future cost
instead (from the current position to the finish) saves 25% by totally
preventing the extra loops. A smaller 5% gain is generated by skipping checking
for cave-to-cave moves as they will eventually be double-checked with a two-step
move anyway.

# Second optimizations (mergedc.awk)

Another 10% increase in speed can be found if moving to the hallway is split
into separate movements to the left and the right, aborting the attempts at the
first blockage. This also removes the need to check for validity of the move as
it is implied by the abort condition.

A extra improvement could be gained by leaving out the checks of the impossible
positions when moving from the hallway into the cave.
