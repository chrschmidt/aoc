There's some assumptions made on the data in order to solve part 2:

* It's not intended to actually brute force the solution
* If there is a faster way, it is assumed to require periodic solutions, e.g. every end looping back to itself
* There's no path connection in a way that one starting point can hit multiple ending points
* While it would be possible that the periods only occur after an initial offset, leading to a linear equation system, the data has not shown this
